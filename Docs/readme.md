# CMPT 276 Assignment 3: Garden Trouble Game

A Minesweeper inspired Android gaming application where I planned and designed each User Interface with animations, buttons, dialog messages and sounds.

### How to Play:
Grandma Joe loves planting vegetables in her garden. Unfortunately, cute little rabbits have started to eat her vegetables! Help Grandma Joe find all the rabbits in her garden by tapping on the cells. When no rabbit is found, the cell will be scanned and a hint will be provided stating how many rabbits are hidden in the column and row of the cell tapped. When a rabbit is found, you will be updated with how many rabbits are remaining to be found. Find all the rabbits in the least number of scans. Good Luck!

Welcome screen: Animation <br />
Main Menu: Visually appealing buttons and UI <br />
Game: Scanning animation along row/column when scanning for mines <br />
