    <string name="txtCredit">ABOUT THE AUTHOR:\n\nHi there! My Name is Jasleen Kaur and am in <a href="https://www.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/276/bfraser/index.html">CMPT 276.</a>
        Hope you enjoy this game made by a brown little girl :)
        \n\nHOW TO PLAY:\n\nGrandma Joe loves planting vegetables in her garden.
        Unfortunately, cute little rabbits have started to eat her vegetables!
        Help Grandma Joe find all the rabbits in her garden by clicking on the cells.
        When no rabbit is found, the cell will be scanned and a hint will be given stating how many rabbits are present in the column or row of the cell clicked.
        When a rabbit is found, you will be updated with how many rabbits are remaining to be found. Find all the rabbits in the least number of scans\n\nGood Luck!
